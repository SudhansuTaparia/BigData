# Big Data Technologies

This is a repository i have created to put up some of the knowledge i have gained around Big Data Technologies especially Spark, GraphX etc.

## SPARK
Apache Sparkâ„¢ is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.
Apache Spark achieves high performance for both batch and streaming data, using a state-of-the-art DAG scheduler, a query optimizer, and a physical execution engine.

## GRAPHX
GraphX is Apache Spark's API for graphs and graph-parallel computation.
GraphX unifies ETL, exploratory analysis, and iterative graph computation within a single system. You can view the same data as both graphs and collections, transform and join graphs with RDDs efficiently, and write custom iterative graph algorithms using the Pregel API.

## SPARK SQL
Spark SQL is Apache Spark's module for working with structured data.
Spark SQL lets you query structured data inside Spark programs, using either SQL or a familiar DataFrame API. Usable in Java, Scala, Python and R.

## SPARK STREAMING
Spark Streaming makes it easy to build scalable fault-tolerant streaming applications.
Spark Streaming brings Apache Spark's language-integrated API to stream processing, letting you write streaming jobs the same way you write batch jobs. It supports Java, Scala and Python.

## MLLIB
MLlib is Apache Spark's scalable machine learning library.
MLlib fits into Spark's APIs and interoperates with NumPy in Python (as of Spark 0.9) and R libraries (as of Spark 1.5). You can use any Hadoop data source (e.g. HDFS, HBase, or local files), making it easy to plug into Hadoop workflows.
