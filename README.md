# Big Data Technologies

This is a repository i have created to put up some of the knowledge i have gained around Big Data Technologies especially Spark, GraphX etc.

## GRAPHX
GraphX is Apache Spark's API for graphs and graph-parallel computation.
GraphX unifies ETL, exploratory analysis, and iterative graph computation within a single system. You can view the same data as both graphs and collections, transform and join graphs with RDDs efficiently, and write custom iterative graph algorithms using the Pregel API.

## SPARK SQL
Spark SQL is Apache Spark's module for working with structured data.
Spark SQL lets you query structured data inside Spark programs, using either SQL or a familiar DataFrame API. Usable in Java, Scala, Python and R.
